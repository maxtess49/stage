All benchmarks instances from three well known multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP) libraries are provided in a standard format here, as used in Drake et al. (2016). 
This includes: 
- The SAC-94 dataset, based on a variety of real-world problems. 
- The ORLib dataset proposed by Chu and Beasley (1998). 
- The GK dataset proposed by Glover and Kochenberger (n.d). 

The format of these data files is: 
#Variables (n), #Constraints (m), Optimal value (0 if unavailable), 
Profit P(j) for each n, 
m x n matrix of constraints, 
Capacity b(i) for each m. 

We would appreciate it if any use of these files is credited with a reference to Drake et al. (2016). 

These instances were previously available at http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~jqd/mkp/index.html.
