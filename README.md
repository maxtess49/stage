# Welcome to the jungle
## Project of my internship at LERIA 

### Objectives: 
    - Implement bGWO, bMS, bABC 
    - Develop a kind of general metaheuristics algorithm from those

### TODO
- bGWO
  - [ ] Make an algorithm from scratch
  - [ ] Find where to generalize and make a framework
    - Initialisation
    - Identify leaders (selection)
    - Estimate the position of the prey (??)
    - Generate solution (mutate)
    - Update population (Insertion)
  - [ ] (optionnal) make it with the deap library
- bMS
- bABC
- General algorithm
